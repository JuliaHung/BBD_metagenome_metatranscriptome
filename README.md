# BBD_metagenome_metatranscriptome
<br/>

 **Descrption:**
Repository for scripts and resources of (1) recovering near-complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from coral Black Band Disease (BBD) lesion using Oxford nanopore long-read sequencing data, and (2) comparing microbial gene expression under different light regimes using differential gene expression analysis.

**Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing**

The recovered 28 BBD-derived, near-complete MAGs from this study are available at [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27611787).

The script used to recover MAGs is in the "metagenome" folder, and the workflow as showed here.

**Comparative day/night metatranscriptomic analysis of microbial communities in the BBD mat:**

The script used to perform differential gene expression analysis of BBD lesions during daytime and nighttime is in the "metatranscriptome" folder.
