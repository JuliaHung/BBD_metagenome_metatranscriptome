# BBD_metagenome_metatranscriptome
<br/>

 **Description:**
Repository containing scripts and resources for two main analyses:

1. Metagenome (in the metagenome folder): Recovery of near-complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from coral Black Band Disease (BBD) lesions using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing data.

2. Metatranscriptome (in the metatranscriptome folder): Comparison of microbial gene expression under different light conditions using differential gene expression analysis.

**Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing**

The recovered 28 BBD-derived, near-complete MAGs from this study are available at [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27611787).

The script used to recover MAGs is in the "metagenome" folder, and the workflow as showed here.

**Comparative day/night metatranscriptomic analysis of microbial communities in the BBD mat:**

The script used to perform differential gene expression analysis of BBD lesions during daytime and nighttime is in the "metatranscriptome" folder.
